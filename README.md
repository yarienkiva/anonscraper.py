# anonscraper.py
A webscraper to download anonfile hosted files in bulk. Takes a raw pastebin link as input.

> Translation : I got a pastebin of a bunch of links to dumps hosted on anonfile but the js is a pain. Does anybody have a way to not  manually click to download everything?

## How to use

Install the required libraries with ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt"`` the run the script with ``python3 anonscrape.py``. Be sure to do this in a new directory with enough space to download the leaks (otherwhise your filesystem is going to get messy real quick).
